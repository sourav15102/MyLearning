A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers located in different geographic locations around the world.

Here is how a CDN works:
1. A user requests web content, such as a web page, image, or video, from a website.
2. The request is routed to the closest server in the CDN network, based on the userâ€™s geographic location.
3. The CDN server caches the requested content from the origin server, which is the server that hosts the website.
4. If the requested content is not present in the CDN cache, the CDN server retrieves the content from the origin server.
5. The CDN server delivers the requested content to the user, using the fastest and most reliable route available.

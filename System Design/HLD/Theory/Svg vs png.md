SVG is a vector format that is great for icons, logos, and graphics that need to be scaled without losing quality. PNG, on the other hand, is a raster format better suited for photographs or images with complex details. 

File Size: Consider the impact on page load times. SVG files tend to be smaller in size compared to equivalent PNGs, which can lead to faster loading web pages.

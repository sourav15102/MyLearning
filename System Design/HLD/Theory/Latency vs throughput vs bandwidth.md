Let's say Tom goes to a restaurant and orders a cheese sandwich.

The waiter takes the order & returns with the sandwich after 10 minutes.

That's the **latency**.

_Latency = time it takes for a system to respond to a request_

**But what about throughput?**

Imagine Tom, Jack & Darcy go to the restaurant and give their order (cheese sandwiches).

The restaurant was able to handle all the requests.

That's **throughput**.

_Throughput = number of requests that a system can handle within a given amount of time._

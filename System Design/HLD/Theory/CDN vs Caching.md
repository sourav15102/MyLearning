> **while** **CDNs perform caching, not everything that performs caching is a CDN**

Web caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data or web content (such as images, videos, HTML pages, and other resources) on a local server or client-side device to reduce the time it takes to retrieve the content when it is requested again

Web caching can be implemented at different levels of the web architecture, including the client-side, server-side, and intermediary caching (such as a proxy server or content delivery network).

Types:
1. Page caching: (also known as HTTP or site caching) stores data like images, web pages, and other content temporarily when itâ€™s loaded for the **first time**. This data is stored in an unused portion of RAM and has no significant impact on memory.
2. Browser: Caching happening at browser.

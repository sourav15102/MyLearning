### **How They Work Together**

|**Aspect**|**Distributed Locks**|**ACID**|**Two-Phase Commit**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Prevent conflicting operations in a distributed system.|Ensure reliable and consistent transactions.|Coordinate distributed transactions for atomicity.|
|**ACID Relationship**|Provides **Isolation** by locking resources.|Encompasses all ACID properties.|Focuses on **Atomicity** and **Consistency** across nodes.|
|**Dependency**|Locks are used to maintain isolation in ACID systems.|Relies on locks (or similar mechanisms) to ensure ACID.|Uses locks during the prepare phase to ensure consistency.|
|**Challenges**|Fault tolerance, deadlocks, performance overhead.|Difficult to implement in distributed systems.|High latency, blocking, risk of coordinator failure.|

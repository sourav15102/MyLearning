### **When to Choose PostgreSQL Over MySQL**

| **Condition**                         | **PostgreSQL Advantage**                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complex queries and advanced features | Better SQL support (e.g., JSONB, CTEs, window functions).                             |
| Strict ACID compliance                | Ensures robust consistency and transactional integrity.                               |
| High concurrency                      | Superior concurrency handling with MVCC.                                              |
| Complex or nested data models         | Supports custom types, arrays, and object-relational features.                        |
| Geospatial/analytical workloads       | PostGIS for geospatial data and superior analytical performance.                      |
| Extensibility                         | Allows custom extensions and deep configuration.                                      |
| Distributed systems                   | Strong consistency with synchronous replication; better partitioning/sharding options |

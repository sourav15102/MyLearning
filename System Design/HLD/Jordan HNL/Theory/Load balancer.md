Load balancers distribute traffic to backend servers using various methods, each suited to different scenarios. Here's an overview of common traffic distribution strategies and the role of consistent hashing:

### Common Load Balancing Strategies

1. **Round Robin**:
   - **How it works**: Requests are distributed sequentially across all servers in the pool. After the last server is reached, the cycle starts again from the first server.
   - **Use Case**: Works well when servers are equally capable and the requests are roughly equal in size.

2. **Least Connections**:
   - **How it works**: Requests are sent to the server with the fewest active connections.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when requests vary significantly in processing time, as it helps balance the load more evenly.

3. **IP Hash**:
   - **How it works**: The client's IP address is used to determine which server will handle the request. The IP address is hashed, and the resulting value is used to select a server.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when you want to ensure that a client always connects to the same server, provided the set of servers remains constant.

4. **Weighted Round Robin**:
   - **How it works**: Servers are assigned weights based on their capacity, and requests are distributed proportionally.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal when servers have different capacities.

5. **Random**:
   - **How it works**: Requests are distributed to servers randomly.
   - **Use Case**: Simple and effective in some scenarios, especially when combined with health checks.

### Consistent Hashing

**Consistent Hashing** is used in scenarios where:
- **Stateful sessions** need to be maintained (session persistence).
- **Caching** systems are in place, and you want to minimize cache misses when scaling in/out.
- **Distributed storage** systems where data should be partitioned and distributed across multiple nodes, ensuring that the load is evenly spread.

**How it works**:
- Each server is assigned a position on a hash ring.
- Each request is hashed, and the resulting value is used to locate a point on the ring.
- The request is routed to the first server encountered when traversing the ring clockwise from the request's hash value.

**Use Case for Consistent Hashing**:
1. **Session Persistence**: If the load balancer uses consistent hashing, the same client request will consistently map to the same server. This is useful for maintaining session persistence, where a client needs to consistently interact with the same backend server (sticky sessions).
2. **Distributed Caching**: In a distributed caching system, consistent hashing helps ensure that each key maps to the same cache node, even when nodes are added or removed, thereby minimizing data movement.
3. **Distributed Data Stores**: In databases like Cassandra, consistent hashing is used to distribute data across nodes and ensure even data distribution.

### When to Use Consistent Hashing

Consistent hashing is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- **Nodes can dynamically join or leave**: It minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped, thus reducing the impact on the system.
- **Data locality and distribution are crucial**: For caching or sharding in distributed databases, consistent hashing helps in maintaining an even load distribution.

In summary, while traditional load balancing strategies like round robin or least connections focus on distributing incoming requests, consistent hashing is used when the stateful handling of sessions, data, or caching is required. It provides a mechanism to ensure that the same input consistently routes to the same server, even as the server pool changes, making it ideal for scenarios where minimizing disruption and maintaining consistency are critical.

When choosing between **Kafka**, **Kinesis**, and **RabbitMQ**, the **Transactions Per Second (TPS)** is an important consideration. Each tool is optimized for different use cases and has varying performance capabilities. Here’s a breakdown of their suitability based on TPS and other considerations:

---

### **1. Apache Kafka**

- **TPS Suitability:**
    - Kafka is designed for **high throughput** and can handle **millions of TPS**. In real-world scenarios:
        - Can achieve **10 million+ messages/second** (for large clusters).
        - Scales horizontally by adding brokers and partitions.
- **Best For:**
    - **Event streaming**, log aggregation, and real-time analytics.
    - Use cases with **large-scale data ingestion**, such as IoT, data pipelines, or clickstream analysis.
- **Trade-Offs:**
    - High setup complexity (requires Zookeeper or Kafka Raft).
    - Designed for **at least-once delivery**, making exactly-once semantics harder to implement.

### **2. Amazon Kinesis**

- **TPS Suitability:**
    - Kinesis can handle **thousands of TPS per shard**, and each shard can process:
        - **1,000 records per second (writes)** OR **1 MB/sec of data**.
        - **5,000 records per second (reads)** OR **2 MB/sec of data**.
    - For higher TPS, you can add more shards (scales linearly).
- **Best For:**
    - Real-time data streaming on AWS with seamless integration with AWS services (e.g., Lambda, Redshift).
    - Medium to high TPS workloads (tens of thousands of TPS).
- **Trade-Offs:**
    - **Cost scales with shards**, which can become expensive for extremely high TPS.
    - AWS vendor lock-in.

### **3. RabbitMQ**

- **TPS Suitability:**
    - RabbitMQ supports **20K–50K messages/second** per queue in most setups.
        - With optimizations, it can handle **up to 1 million messages/second** in clustered setups.
- **Best For:**
    - **Low-latency transactional messaging** (e.g., task queues, point-to-point communication).
    - Use cases where **message ordering and acknowledgment** are important.
- **Trade-Offs:**
    - Lower throughput compared to Kafka or Kinesis.
    - Not optimized for high-latency, high-volume streaming workloads.

### **Comparison of TPS Suitability**

| **Tool**     | **Suitable TPS Range**      | **Scaling Capability**            | **Best For**                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kafka**    | **1M+ TPS (per cluster)**   | Scales horizontally (add brokers) | High-throughput, large-scale data pipelines, events. |
| **Kinesis**  | **10K–1M TPS** (via shards) | Linear scaling via shards         | AWS-integrated real-time analytics and streaming.    |
| **RabbitMQ** | **20K–1M TPS** (clustered)  | Limited compared to Kafka/Kinesis | Low-latency task queues, transactional messaging.    |

### **Which to Choose Based on TPS:**

1. **For High TPS (1M+):**
    - Choose **Kafka** for massive-scale workloads where throughput is critical.
2. **For Medium TPS (10K–1M):**
    - Use **Kinesis** if your system is AWS-based and requires managed services.
3. **For Low-to-Medium TPS (20K–50K):**
    - Use **RabbitMQ** for task processing or message routing in transactional systems.

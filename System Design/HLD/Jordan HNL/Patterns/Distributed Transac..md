2. Message broker + Task Runners  = can be used to retry again in cases of idempotent.
3. Non-Idempotent = 2PC is anyways tough, but if dbs are heterogenous or they are distributed dbs, it will me more tough.
	1. Zookeeper can be used to coordinate among two diff types of dbs.

Even Zookeeper can be slow though.
### **Summary of CDC to Kafka to Flink to DB Pipeline**

1. **CDC from 1st DB to Kafka:**
    
    - Use a CDC tool (e.g., Debezium) to capture changes from the source database and write them as events to Kafka topics.
    - Ensure **retry mechanisms** and **dead letter queues (DLQs)** for failed writes to Kafka.
2. **Kafka to Flink:**
    
    - Flink consumes events from Kafka topics, processes them in real-time, and manages **stateful transformations**.
    - Ensure **exactly-once semantics** with checkpointing to handle failures.
3. **Flink to 2nd DB:**
    
    - Flink writes processed events to the target database.
    - Use **idempotent writes** to ensure consistency during retries.
4. **Failure Recovery:**
    
    - Kafka retains unprocessed messages for replay in case of Flink failure.
    - DLQs and alerts handle unrecoverable failures at each stage.

### **Key Benefits:**

- **Durability:** Kafka retains logs for reprocessing.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Flinkâ€™s checkpointing ensures exactly-once guarantees.
- **Scalability:** Decoupled architecture allows independent scaling of each component.

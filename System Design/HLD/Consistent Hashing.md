Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to efficiently distribute and manage data across a dynamic set of nodes. It provides a way to map keys (such as data items or tasks) to nodes in a consistent and balanced manner, even when the number of nodes in the system changes.

Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Node Ring:**
    
    - Imagine a circle, which represents a hash ring. Each point on the circle corresponds to a node in the distributed system.
2. **Key Assignment:**
    
    - When a key (data item or task) needs to be assigned to a node, it is hashed to generate a numerical value.
    - This numerical value determines a point on the circle.
3. **Node Assignment:**
    
    - The key is then assigned to the node whose corresponding point on the circle is the first encountered in a clockwise direction from the hashed value.

**Advantages:**

1. **Balanced Distribution:**
    
    - Consistent hashing ensures a balanced distribution of keys among nodes. When a node joins or leaves the system, only a fraction of the keys needs to be remapped, minimizing the impact on the overall system.
2. **Scalability:**
    
    - It's particularly beneficial in scenarios where nodes can be added or removed dynamically. When a new node is added, only a portion of the keys is reassigned, and when a node is removed, only the keys associated with that node need to be remapped.
3. **Efficient Query Routing:**
    
    - Consistent hashing provides an efficient mechanism for routing queries to the appropriate node. Given a key, the system can quickly determine the responsible node without needing to consult a centralized directory.
4. **Load Balancing:**
    
    - Nodes are spread evenly across the hash ring, promoting a balanced load distribution. This helps prevent hotspots where a disproportionate number of keys are assigned to a specific node.

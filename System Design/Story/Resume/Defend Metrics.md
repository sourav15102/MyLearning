### **Metrics from Your Resume and How to Defend Them**

#### **1. Performance Improvement**

- **Metric**: _"Improved application performance by X%"_
- **How to Defend**:
    - **Tool Used**: Yes, you can absolutely say **New Relic**! Itâ€™s a widely accepted tool for measuring application performance.
    - **What You Did**:
        - Identified bottlenecks (e.g., slow APIs, heavy database queries) using New Relic APM.
        - Optimized query execution times, added caching (e.g., Redis), or reduced unnecessary API calls.
    - **Explanation**:
        - "Using New Relic, we tracked the response time of key APIs. After optimizing database queries and introducing Redis caching, we saw a 30% reduction in latency for high-traffic endpoints."

#### **2. Reduced Code Smells or Technical Debt**

- **Metric**: _"Reduced technical debt by X%"_
- **How to Defend**:
    - **Tool Used**: **SonarQube**.
    - **What You Did**:
        - Ran SonarQube scans to identify code smells (e.g., long methods, unused variables).
        - Refactored code using design patterns like Single Responsibility Principle or Dependency Injection.
    - **Explanation**:
        - "I used SonarQube to identify areas of improvement. For example, we reduced cyclomatic complexity in service classes and eliminated dead code, which decreased the technical debt score by 30% over two sprints."

#### **3. Increased Test Coverage**

- **Metric**: _"Increased test coverage to 85%"_
- **How to Defend**:
    - **Tool Used**: **Jacoco** (for Java).
    - **What You Did**:
        - Wrote unit tests for untested services and edge cases.
        - Focused on critical business logic and high-risk modules.
    - **Explanation**:
        - "We ran Jacoco during the CI/CD pipeline to measure test coverage. By adding comprehensive tests for payment processing and authentication modules, we raised coverage to 85% from 50%."

#### **4. Deployment Time Reduction**

- **Metric**: _"Reduced deployment time by X%"_
- **How to Defend**:
    - **Tool Used**: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or a similar tool.
    - **What You Did**:
        - Optimized CI/CD pipelines by introducing parallel builds and caching dependencies.
    - **Explanation**:
        - "We reduced deployment time by 40% in Jenkins by caching Maven dependencies and running tests in parallel stages."

#### **5. Bug Reduction**

- **Metric**: _"Reduced production bugs by X%"_
- **How to Defend**:
    - **Tool Used**: Jira (to track bugs), New Relic (to monitor errors).
    - **What You Did**:
        - Focused on edge-case testing, implemented robust error handling, and added integration tests.
    - **Explanation**:
        - "Using Jira reports, we tracked the number of production issues. By implementing integration tests and automating edge-case scenarios, we reduced critical bugs in production by 40%."

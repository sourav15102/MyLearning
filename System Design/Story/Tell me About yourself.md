Problem-solving has always been my passion—even as a kid, I loved puzzles and figuring out how things worked. In high school, I learned Java and Android Studio, and I’d create APK files, forcing people to install my apps just to show them my work.

This passion naturally led me to pursue a **bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering**, which built a strong foundation in software development and algorithms. In 2018, during my third year, I was placed at **MathWorks** as a Software Developer.

At MathWorks, I focused on **backend development** and worked on improving tools for customers and internal teams. I **led a project** involving architectural changes to improve the **dimensional accuracy** of a simulation software component. This was my first exposure to handling large-scale challenges, and I worked there for **3.5 years**, constantly staying updated on **cloud technologies, distributed systems**, and **system design**.

My curiosity for deeper technical knowledge led me to pursue a **master’s in Computer Science** at Dalhousie University. Working with talented peers on exciting projects was an enriching experience, and during my second-last semester, I was placed at the **Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)** as a Software Engineer.

At CRA, I tackled **large-scale system challenges** on platforms like **Formal File Dispute (FFD)** and **Authorize My Rep (AMR)**. I **led architectural changes and database optimizations**, worked on reducing technical debt, and consolidating backend services keeping them **scalable and resilient**.

Fingible: 60mins
Intro: Current role, 
technical: problem statemet. live coding: DSA ambuigity, very ambiguous, simple clean code.
5 step coding methodology: 
- 2 mins - clarifying question. Dive deep, learn and be curious
- 2 mins; rehrase the question, in own words: make sure I got right, give overview: input, method i will use.
- 3-4 mins: layout algo: Time and space complexity
- 10-15 mins: subopimal first, and then optimal: write code, logic, speak speak
- 5 mins: review code: couple of edge cases. future enhancements, scallability: thing big
Fudamentals of DSA

Bhevairoul:
- went over and beyond 
- simplified the process.
- 8 stories: strong and complex: 3-4 mins
	- STAR method.
- 2 - 10mins each st < AR (Success measure, data) my contrbution, use Term I, not We
- Use Data, quantify
- wwrite about stories
- show scope, reflect level 5, strong and complex

Questioms:
- learn and be curious
- Linkedin: lookup interviewers on linkedin.
- You might ask about the role specifically, business-related questions, specific projects or initiatives, cultural aptitude, or anything else you can think of

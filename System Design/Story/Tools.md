**Q: Can We Drill Down Further Using New Relic or Datadog?**
Yes, tools like **New Relic** and **Datadog APM** allow you to **drill down within a specific service** and complement Jaeger in the following ways:
1. **What New Relic or Datadog Adds**:
    - Provides **application-level monitoring**, showing detailed metrics like:
        - Response time for individual API endpoints.
        - Database query performance within the service.
        - CPU and memory usage of the service.
    - Tracks specific transactions or user flows within a service.
    - Identifies slow methods or database queries that are the root cause of performance issues.
2. **Granular Details** (What Jaeger Cannot Do):
    - Jaeger: Shows **Service B** is slow.
    - New Relic/Datadog: Explains **why** Service B is slow by showing:
        - A specific SQL query taking 400ms.
        - A thread pool being exhausted due to a misconfiguration.

**Q: New Relic in a Distributed Microservice Environment**
- **Capabilities**:
    - Tracks application metrics (latency, throughput, error rates) for each service.
    - Provides **distributed tracing** through **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**.
    - Correlates traces with other metrics like resource usage (CPU, memory) and database performance.
    - Offers dashboards and alerts for real-time monitoring.
- **How It Works**:
    - Deploy lightweight **agents** in each service.
    - Agents automatically collect trace data, metrics, and errors.
    - New Relic generates distributed traces for requests flowing through microservices.

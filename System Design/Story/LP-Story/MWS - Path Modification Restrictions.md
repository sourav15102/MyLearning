#### **Situation**

During an internal project to deploy a MATLAB-based automation tool, I designed a modular workflow where scripts dynamically added dependencies to the MATLAB search path using `addpath`. This was intended to simplify updates, as new modules could be introduced without modifying the core codebase.

#### **Why the Request Couldn't Be Fulfilled**

When testing the deployed application, I discovered that `addpath` was unsupported in the deployed environment due to MATLAB Compiler restrictions. The fixed path in the MATLAB Runtime environment made it impossible to dynamically add required directories.

#### **How I Managed It**

I reorganized the application by consolidating all dependencies into a single pre-defined directory and ensured all paths were included at compile time. I also documented the fixed directory structure for future updates.

#### **Result**

Although less flexible, the solution worked seamlessly in the deployed environment. The project was delivered successfully, and I shared this limitation as a best practice in the internal developer knowledge base.

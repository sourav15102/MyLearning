**Situation**

A customer in the **renewable energy sector** used **Simscape Electrical** to model a complex wind turbine system and demanded high-fidelity real-time simulation for their entire electrical grid. This was computationally unfeasible on their existing hardware without simplifying their model or lowering fidelity.

#### **Why the Request Couldn't Be Fulfilled**

- **Technical Limitation**: Simscape’s high-fidelity simulation of large systems requires breaking models into smaller subsystems to reduce computational overhead.
- **Hardware Constraint**: Their system lacked sufficient CPU and memory for such a large-scale simulation.

#### **Action**

1. **Transparent Communication**: Explained the limitations and why their request wasn’t feasible while acknowledging their concerns.
2. **Proposed Alternative**:
    - Suggested **model partitioning** and **co-simulation** to balance fidelity and computational requirements.
    - Assisted with a test case demonstrating that this approach maintained accuracy while reducing load.
3. **Support**: Provided resources and hands-on support to transition their workflow.

#### **Result**

- The customer implemented model partitioning and co-simulation, achieving their goals without hardware upgrades.
- They appreciated the practical solution and adopted these best practices for future projects.

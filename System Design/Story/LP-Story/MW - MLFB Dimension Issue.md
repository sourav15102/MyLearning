>A client in the automation industry faced a dimension mismatch issue in their intricate MATLAB Function Block (MLFB) codebase, leading to time-consuming manual debugging. Understanding their frustration, I prioritized the issue, provided a temporary workaround. Through transparent communication, I kept them updated on the progress of a permanent fix. 

**Situation:**  
While working at MathWorks as an application developer, I was handling customer queries. A customer in the automation industry was facing a critical issue with a MATLAB function block. The block was sporadically converting a row vector input (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) into a scalar output, causing inconsistencies in their automation program. This unexpected behavior was disrupting their operations. The sporadic nature of the issue made it even worse.

**Task:**  
I informed the customer about the root cause of the problem and assured them that a long-term fix was being planned. Additionally, I raised the issue internally with my manager and other stakeholders to initiate a dedicated project for resolving the problem comprehensively.

**Action:** 
2. **Raising Awareness:** I escalated the problem to my manager, emphasizing its impact on the customer and proposing a dedicated project to address it.
3. **Customer Engagement:** I informed the customer about the root cause and provided them with a temporary workaround to minimize disruption while the long-term fix was in progress.
4. **Project Leadership:** I was assigned as the lead for the project, which required significant architectural changes to the codebase to resolve the dimensional inconsistencies.
5. **Execution:** Over four months, I worked on rearchitecting the MATLAB function block, involving thorough testing.
6. **Ensure backward compatibility**: A switch was given in MLFB for that.

**Result:**

- Successfully delivered the revised MATLAB function block to the customer after four months of focused work, completely resolving the dimension mismatch issue.
- The customer was highly appreciative of the proactive engagement and transparent communication throughout the process.
- The new solution not only met their immediate needs but also improved the robustness of the MATLAB function block for future users, showcasing MathWorks' commitment to customer satisfaction.
- As a result, the customer’s operational efficiency improved significantly, and they continued to trust MathWorks' tools for their automation processes.**

### Implementation Details:

1. Identify issue: I used MATLAB’s built-in profiling tool 'Profile' to trace the data flow and identify the source of the dimension mismatch in the MATLAB Function Block. 
```
profile on
```
To enhance visibility, I added diagnostic logging within the block to record input and output dimensions at key stages. 
```
disp(['Input dimensions: ', mat2str(size(inputData))]);
outputData = someFunction(inputData);
disp(['Output dimensions: ', mat2str(size(outputData))]);
```
I identified that all intermediate services maintained correct dimensions. However, the profiling data revealed that the issue stemmed from the output service, where dimensions were inconsistently transformed under specific conditions, leading to the sporadic mismatch.

#### Root Cause:
Through extensive debugging and consultation with the internal documentation, I discovered that the issue was caused by **an edge case in the block’s internal handling of implicit broadcasting**. If the input row vector contained repeated identical elements, an optimization routine in the MATLAB Function Block would mistakenly treat it as a scalar to save memory. This routine was triggered only under certain memory thresholds and runtime conditions, making the behavior sporadic and hard to reproduce.
**Task:**  

Pattern:
**Identifying the Memory-Dependent Trigger:**  
By profiling the system, I noticed a correlation between memory usage and the occurrence of the issue. Specifically:

- When memory consumption crossed a predefined threshold, a secondary optimization routine would activate.
- This routine aimed to compress dimensions to minimize memory overhead but failed to preserve input-output consistency.

**Designing the New Routine with Strict Mode:**  
To address the issue, I proposed a **configurable routine** with a `Strict Mode` parameter. In this mode:

- The routine would skip the dimension-compression optimization.
- All other optimizations (e.g., memory allocation and caching) would remain intact.


### Make sure it doesn't appear again:
1. **Documentation**:
	- After identifying the root cause (an edge case in **implicit broadcasting** causing dimension mismatches), I thoroughly documented the issue, including:
	    - The conditions that triggered the bug (e.g., repeated identical elements in a row vector).
	    - The impact of the optimization routine's incorrect assumption.
2. **Extensive Testing**:
	- Designed and executed **comprehensive test cases** to cover:
	    - Edge cases like vectors with identical elements.
	    - Varying memory thresholds and runtime conditions that previously triggered the bug.
	- Added these test cases to MATLAB’s **continuous integration (CI) pipeline** to prevent regressions in future releases.

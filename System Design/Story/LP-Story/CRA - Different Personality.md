### **Proposed Story: Adapting to a Dynamic and Informal Collaboration Style in the Dispute Assignment System**

#### **Situation**

At CRA, I worked with a colleague on the **SQS-based dispute assignment system**, who thrived in a highly dynamic and informal manner. They preferred brainstorming on the go and quick ad-hoc decisions, often avoiding documentation or detailed planning. In contrast, I leaned toward structured workflows, semi-formal meetings, and thorough documentation. While I understood their approach had benefits, particularly in fostering creativity, it became challenging to maintain alignment as we approached a tight deadline.

#### **Task**

The task was to streamline our collaboration to ensure clarity in decision-making and progress tracking, without stifling the dynamic aspects of their working style, while delivering a dynamic scheduling mechanism to meet the deadline.

#### **Action**

1. **Adapting to Their Style**:
    
    - I began and ended meetings on a light, informal note to align with their preferred atmosphere, which encouraged open discussion.
    - Acknowledged their quick decision-making skills as critical during brainstorming sessions.
2. **Introducing Structure**:
    
    - Politely requested them to document **key decisions** made during discussions, explaining how this would minimize confusion during implementation.
    - Created **tables outlining the pros and cons** of different approaches to ensure clarity when evaluating options.
    - Introduced **structured mini-sessions** during brainstorming to capture insights while keeping discussions dynamic.
3. **Balancing Informality and Structure**:
    
    - Ensured that while creative discussions flowed freely, they culminated in actionable items with clear owners and deadlines.
    - Used task trackers to centralize key decisions and responsibilities without overwhelming them with formality.

#### **Result**

Our collaborative adjustments improved the overall process, leading to the successful implementation of a dynamic scheduling mechanism that **reduced SLA violations by 20%**. The blend of dynamic brainstorming and structured decision-making allowed us to meet the deadline effectively while leveraging both our strengths. Additionally, I developed an appreciation for the flexibility and agility their style brought to problem-solving.

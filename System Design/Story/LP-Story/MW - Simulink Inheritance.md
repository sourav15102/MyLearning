### **Invent and Simplify: Delivering an Imaginative Idea**

#### **Situation**

At MathWorks, I proposed a novel idea to enhance the flexibility of Simulink models. Instead of limiting users to a fixed set of configuration options within MATLAB Function Blocks (MLFB), I suggested exposing **inheritable functions** within the blocks. This would allow users to **override default behaviors** and implement custom logic tailored to their specific needs. For example, users could customize numerical solvers without modifying the main block logic, making the blocks more adaptable to advanced use cases.

#### **Task**

My task was to design a prototype demonstrating how this idea could improve model flexibility, reduce user frustration, and align with MathWorks’ goals of empowering users. However, I needed to ensure that the proposed changes didn’t compromise security or create risks in shared workflows.

#### **Action**

1. **Developing the Prototype**:
    
    - Created a proof-of-concept using Simulink and MATLAB Function Blocks, introducing **virtual methods** that could be inherited and overridden by user-defined functions.
    - Demonstrated a sample use case where users could implement custom optimization routines directly within their simulation environment.
2. **Stakeholder Pushback**:
    
    - During reviews with stakeholders, concerns arose about the **security implications** of exposing too much block functionality.
    - Stakeholders feared that allowing users to override core functions could lead to **unintended behavior**, especially in collaborative or shared environments, where one user’s custom logic could inadvertently disrupt another’s workflow.
    - Highlighted the risk of **malicious overrides** or accidental breaches in models used in regulated industries, where maintaining integrity is critical.
3. **Addressing Concerns**:
    
    - Proposed adding **access control mechanisms** to restrict function overrides to authorized users or teams.
    - Suggested deploying the feature in an **isolated development sandbox**, limiting its impact on shared or production environments.
    - Offered to include detailed documentation and safeguards to mitigate risks while ensuring user empowerment.
4. **Decision to Pause**:
    
    - Despite these efforts, the proposal was paused due to **security concerns** and the need for additional architectural safeguards before implementation. The team decided to prioritize enhancements to existing workflows that offered similar benefits with lower risks.

#### **Result**

1. **Short-Term Impact**:
    
    - While the feature wasn’t implemented, the discussions highlighted the importance of balancing flexibility with security in product design.
    - The idea and prototype were archived for potential future development as part of a controlled environment.
2. **Personal Takeaways**:
    
    - Gained valuable insights into stakeholder alignment and the importance of addressing security considerations early in the design phase.
    - The experience reinforced the need to consider both innovation and risk mitigation in delivering scalable solutions.

### **Earn Trust (Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit): When You Received Negative Feedback About Yourself or Your Performance**

#### **Situation**

At CRA, I was working on an automated file categorization system for taxpayer disputes. My primary focus was on achieving high accuracy using advanced NLP techniques. However, during a project review, I received feedback that my focus on technical accuracy caused delays and introduced inefficiencies. Specifically, some categories were unnecessarily detailed because I hadn’t collaborated with the business teams to understand that **subcategories like “Y” could be grouped under parent categories like “X”** without loss of meaning.

#### **Task**

I needed to address the feedback, align the categorization logic with business requirements, and ensure that my work met the practical needs of the teams using the system, all while maintaining the project timeline.

#### **Action**

1. **Engaged Business Teams**:
    
    - Scheduled workshops with the business team to understand how disputes were processed and which category groupings would suffice.
    - Collaborated to redefine the classification hierarchy, consolidating redundant categories and aligning it with operational workflows.
2. **Simplified the Model**:
    
    - Reduced the granularity of the classification model by training it to prioritize parent categories where child categories were redundant.
    - Adjusted confidence thresholds to account for overlaps between parent and child categories.
3. **Established a Feedback Loop**:
    
    - Set up regular sync-ups with the business team to review misclassified disputes and refine the model iteratively.
    - Used their input to retrain the NLP model with real-world examples.
4. **Proactive Communication**:
    
    - Kept the team updated on the changes, explaining how the adjustments would improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

#### **Result**

1. **Improved Accuracy and Efficiency**:
    
    - The changes reduced processing time for disputes by **20%** while maintaining **91% classification accuracy** for key categories.
    - Eliminated the over-categorization issue, ensuring disputes were categorized at the right level of detail.
3. **Personal Growth**:
    
    - The experience highlighted the importance of balancing technical innovation with practical usability, shaping how I approach collaboration in future projects.

**Why Amazon?**

Culturally, I’ve been a long-time Prime member and have always been impressed by Amazon’s customer obsession. I also know three friends who work here, and they’ve shared amazing things about the ownership culture. Plus, I admire how Amazon contributes to communities, like during the pandemic and floods.

Functionally, I have briefly worked on Amazon Aurora, due to Its performance compared to MySQL (previously used)—5X MySQL, 3X PostgreSQL—and the fact that it’s fully managed are game-changers, trusted by brands like Samsung and Nintendo. It’s inspiring to contribute to such impactful innovations.

My term with the Canada Revenue Agency ended on December 30th, they have a policy of hiring non-citizens only on a fixed-term basis. They were facing budget constraints  all term employees' contracts at that time. It was a valuable experience, and I was fortunate to receive amazing references and a recommendation from my previous manager.


4. Peer Feedback

Response:
My peers often highlight my ability to mentor and guide teams, especially in resolving technical challenges. For instance, during the event-driven execution system project at MathWorks, I mentored a junior developer, helping them design a solution that improved simulation efficiency by 35%. I believe my strengths lie in fostering collaboration and solving complex technical issues. However, some peers have suggested that I should delegate more often to allow others to take ownership of tasks—a skill I’m actively developing by mentoring and entrusting tasks to team members.

5. Expectations from Role
Response:
I am excited about the opportunity to design and implement innovative features while working in an agile, collaborative environment. Given my experience with building REST APIs, designing scalable microservices, and using modern frontend technologies like Angular and React, I am confident in my ability to align with IBM’s goals. Additionally, I look forward to growing within IBM by contributing to high-performing teams and expanding my expertise in cloud services like AWS and GCP.

6. Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
I excel in problem-solving and system optimization, as demonstrated by my work at CRA, where I reduced API response times by 45% through unified service design​ My ability to collaborate across teams and mentor junior developers is another strong suit.  
**Weaknesses**:
. My ability to collaborate across teams and mentor junior developers is another strong suit.
Weaknesses:
At times, I overcommit to ambitious goals, as seen during the MathWorks performance optimization project​. I’ve since improved by setting realistic milestones and regularly communicating progress to stakeholders.


#### **7. Report Writing Experience**
**Response**:  
I have extensive experience in writing technical documentation, such as post-deployment reports and user manuals. For example, after optimizing the **Formal File Dispute (FFD) system** at CRA, I documented the architecture, workflows, and best practices for future enhancements​ This ensured team-wide understanding and simplified onboarding for new developers. I am confident in my ability to write clear, detailed reports that align with technical and managerial requirements.

**What do you know about IBM’s history and role in AI?**  
IBM has been a pioneer in AI for over 70 years, using checkers for first neural netorks, starting with **Shoebox**, the first speech-recognition system, and advancing machine learning with early neural networks. It achieved major milestones like **Deep Blue** defeating a chess champion and **Watson** winning _Jeopardy!_ IBM’s current innovation, **watsonx**, empowers enterprises with scalable AI solutions.

**How does IBM compare to its competitors in the AI space?**  
IBM stands out by focusing on **enterprise AI** tailored for real-world applications, rather than emphasizing on consumer-facing tools. IBM’s **watsonx** platform supports end-to-end AI workflows, enabling businesses to train, deploy, and scale models efficiently while maintaining transparency. IBM has also helped in **hybrid cloud adoption**, powered by **Red Hat OpenShift**, allowing **90% of Fortune 500 companies** to manage workloads across diverse environments seamlessly. 

**Why do you want to work here?**  
IBM’s long-standing leadership in AI, commitment to innovation to other products IBM cloud and IBM quantum, and its focus on building technology that is open, ethical, and accessible to everyone. The way IBM creates customizable solutions, like watsonx, to empower businesses across industries while addressing real-world challenges is inspiring. I want to contribute to projects that have a tangible impact and help shape technology that not only drives innovation but also makes the world better. Working at IBM would give me the chance to grow alongside talented individuals in an environment that values collaboration and purpose-driven technology.

**Tell me about a time you encountered a critical bug or issue in production. How did you resolve it?**
At MathWorks, during the deployment of the **Baseline Generation Tool**, I encountered a critical production issue where deeply nested Simulink models caused stack overflow errors, disrupting the tool's functionality for edge-case models.
1. **Identification**: Users reported failures in processing certain models. I analyzed error logs and used MATLAB Profiler to trace the issue to recursive calls in the serialization logic.
2. **Isolation**: Replicated the issue in a test environment with sample models exceeding 50 levels of nesting, confirming the problem was specific to recursive metadata handling.
3. **Analysis**: The root cause was inefficient recursive logic for processing model hierarchies, which led to stack overflow errors and performance bottlenecks.
4. **Resolution**: I replaced the recursive algorithm with an iterative approach and optimized metadata handling to reduce memory usage and processing time
5. **Testing and Validation**: Conducted rigorous stress testing on a variety of models, including edge cases, to ensure robustness and prevent regressions.
6. **Deployment and Monitoring**: After deploying the fix, I closely monitored user feedback and system logs to confirm the resolution was effective and stable.


Why:
### Why I’m Excited About AWS and Aurora CP Team

Many of my college mates and two of my friends are working at AWS in India, and their experiences have been incredibly inspiring. They’ve shared stories about being trusted with **service ownership early on**, having the freedom to bring ideas to life, and the opportunity to see their products go live within weeks, making a significant impact. The culture at AWS, where motivated individuals constantly thrive to build the next big thing, resonates deeply with me. It’s a company that values and rewards innovation, fosters trust, and creates an ideal environment for geeks like me who are passionate about building.

AWS itself is an excellent example of innovation: what began as an internal tool has transformed into the **world’s leading cloud platform**, empowering businesses globally. With Aurora CP, known for its focus on cutting-edge cloud database solutions, I see an opportunity to contribute to scalable, high-throughput systems that power critical services.

### How I Align with AWS Values

I personally align with these values. I’ve always been someone who pushes for new ideas—for example, I once built a **kitchen app to simplify food ordering for employees**, a project no one asked for but solved a real problem. I’ve worked closely with customers, leading projects end-to-end to deliver on expectations. My curiosity drives me to work on diverse projects, continually learning and growing.

I’ve spent ample time reading **AWS whitepapers**, gaining insight into the thought process and innovation behind its solutions. This reflects my desire to work in an environment like AWS, where solving challenging problems is the norm.

Beyond the technical aspects, I admire Amazon’s social values. During the pandemic and floods in India, I witnessed Amazon’s contributions to communities firsthand. It reinforced my belief that this is a company that values not just technical excellence but also making a positive impact on society.

There are two kinds:
1. Class adaptor pattern
2. Object adapter pattern
### Define
**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces toÂ collaborate.

### Problem
Lets say there is an app which calls different APIs and collects the data and displays it, and now the new API it is dealing with now is sending the data in different format than others. 
Our app only works with previous type of data, it is not recommended to make major changes to the code of the app.

### Solution:
We can have an adaptor which will act as an intermediary between the application and API service, it will do all the work of conversions.

Adaptor vs Proxy:
- Purpose of both is different, proxy acts as same object and does some preprocessing before calling actual service, whereas adaptor is used to make both client and service compatible.
- Proxy and actual service extend same base interface.
- Above is not true for Adaptor design pattern.

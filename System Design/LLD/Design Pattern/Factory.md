### Define:
**Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Problem: 
If our client code is dependent on one 'kind' of object(which can change), it will be less scalable.

### Solution:

### When to use:
Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

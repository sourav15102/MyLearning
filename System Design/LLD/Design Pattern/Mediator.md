Basically for Auction system, one obj sends, and other obejcts of same type (interface) recieves.

Very Similar to Observer patter, but Observer has a diff intent.
In Observer, one is observable and there are bunch of observers 'observing' it.
If observable state change, all observers get notified.

Whereas in Mediator, if one sends message all others get notified.

A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. It is a group of IP addresses that are part of a larger network, but are treated as a separate network segment.

- IPv4 address consists of 32 bits.
- ip addresses in same subnet have first 24 bits same.

So, any of such logical division of IP addresses can be called a **Subnet**.

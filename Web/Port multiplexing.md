Multiplexing with port mapping, also known as Port Address Translation (PAT) or Network Address Port Translation (NAPT), allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address. It achieves this by utilizing different port numbers to distinguish between the various connections.

Here's how multiplexing with port mapping works:

1. Outgoing traffic: When a device from the private network initiates an outgoing connection to a destination on the internet, such as a web server, the NAT device assigns a unique source port number to that connection. The source port is typically a randomly generated number.

2. Port mapping: The NAT device maintains a translation table that maps the private IP address and source port to the public IP address and a corresponding port number. It associates each outgoing connection with a specific port number on the public IP address.

3. Routing: The NAT device modifies the outgoing packets, replacing the source IP address with the public IP address and the source port number with the assigned port number. This ensures that the responses from the internet are correctly directed back to the originating device.

4. Incoming traffic: When the internet server responds to the connection request, it sends the response packet to the public IP address and the assigned port number. The NAT device receives the packet and checks the translation table to determine which private IP address and port the packet should be forwarded to.

5. Port demultiplexing: The NAT device uses the port number in the incoming packet to identify the corresponding private IP address and port to which the response should be forwarded. It modifies the destination IP address and port in the packet, replacing them with the private IP address and port of the originating device.

6. Delivery to the device: Finally, the NAT device forwards the response packet to the appropriate device on the private network based on the destination IP address and port information. The device receives the response as if it had a direct communication with the internet server.

By utilizing different port numbers, multiplexing with port mapping enables multiple devices to establish simultaneous connections using a single public IP address. This allows for efficient sharing of limited public IP resources while maintaining proper routing and delivery of packets to the appropriate devices within the private network.

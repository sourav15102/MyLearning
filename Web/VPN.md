A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is another method for making a local server accessible to devices on the internet. A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server, allowing you to connect to your local network from anywhere on the internet. By connecting to a VPN server that is located on your local network, you can access your local server as if you were connected to the same local network, even if you are physically located in a different location.

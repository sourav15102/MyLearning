NIC (Network Interface Card) plays a critical role in facilitating the communication between a server and the network. A NIC is a hardware component that is installed in a server and enables it to connect to a network. It provides a physical interface for the server to send and receive data over the network.

When a server receives a request from a client, it sends the response back through the NIC, which converts the digital data into an electrical signal that can be transmitted over the network. Similarly, when a server needs to retrieve data from a remote device, the NIC receives the data and converts it into digital data that the server can process.

The NIC also provides the server with a unique IP address that identifies it on the network. This IP address is used to route traffic to and from the server. Without a NIC, a server would not be able to connect to the network and communicate with other devices.

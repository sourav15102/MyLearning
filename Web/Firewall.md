A firewall can also be configured to block traffic from specific IP addresses or domains, to allow traffic only from certain protocols or ports, or to restrict traffic to specific times of day or days of the week. Some firewalls can also perform other security functions, such as intrusion detection and prevention, content filtering, and virtual private networking (VPN).

Uses:
- **Network segmentation** is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks, or segments, based on specific security needs or user roles. This is done to limit the exposure of sensitive information or critical systems to unauthorized access, and to control traffic flow between different segments.
- For example, a company may segment its network into different segments based on departments or business units, with each segment having its own firewall and access control policies. This way, even if one segment is compromised, the rest of the network remains secure.
- Network segmentation can be implemented using different techniques, such as virtual local area networks (VLANs), subnets, or physical network separation.
- **Content filtering** is the process of blocking or allowing access to specific types of content or websites based on predefined rules. This is done to prevent access to inappropriate or malicious content that could pose a threat to network security.
- Content filtering can be used to block access to specific websites or types of content, such as gambling or adult content, or to block access to known malware or phishing websites.

Port forwarding involves configuring your router to forward incoming traffic on a specific port to your machine's local IP address. For example, if your server application is running on port 80, you would configure your router to forward incoming traffic on port 80 to your machine's local IP address. This allows devices on the internet to connect to your server by using your router's public IP address and the port number associated with your server application.

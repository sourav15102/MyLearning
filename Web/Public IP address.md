A ***Public IP address*** is a globally unique address that is assigned to a device by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is used to identify the device on the internet. This address is accessible from anywhere in the world and can be used to communicate with the device from any other device on the internet.

***How is it assigned?***
If your router has a public IP address assigned by your ISP, then that IP address is unique to your router and is used to identify your router on the internet. However, all devices connected to your home network will have the same public IP address because they are all connected through the same router.
This is because your router acts as a gateway between your local network and the internet, and it uses network address translation (NAT) to map the private IP addresses of devices on your local network to the public IP address assigned to your router by your ISP
> This means that when devices on your local network communicate with the internet, they all appear to be using the same public IP address assigned to your router.

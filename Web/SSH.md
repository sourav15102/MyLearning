SSH or secure socket shell or secure shell provides us a way to connect from one system to another over network or across the internet.
It used to access a remote system, which can be a server or just another computer.

### Shell:
it is a program that is an interface b/w an OS and a user, which accepts text inputs/commands.

However when we want to use a shell which isn't on system but on a remote one, we use:
### SSH:
It lets us a create secure connection to a remote system to use its shell through our local terminal, when we need to access a remote system to install software, run software and change configurations, we use SSH.

>SSH and terminal tasks are two different things, once we have connected to system using ssh, using it is not a part of ssh.

### SSH client vs server
An *SSH client* is a program that allows a user to remotely connect to an SSH server. The SSH client initiates a connection to the SSH server, and once authenticated, the user can access the server's command line interface and execute commands on the remote system.
An *SSH server*, on the other hand, is a program that listens for incoming SSH connections and allows users to remotely access and manage the system. The SSH server authenticates incoming connections and provides secure access to the system's resources and service

### How to run a SSH server
For this we need an SSH server software, like OpenSSH.

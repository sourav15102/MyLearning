## How ISP get public IPs
ISPs typically obtain their public IP addresses from regional internet registries, such as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), which allocate blocks of IP addresses to ISPs in their respective regions.

Once an ISP obtains a block of public IP addresses, it can then assign individual IP addresses to its routers, modems, and other networking equipment that connect to the internet. This allows the ISP's customers to access the internet and receive a public IP address for their own devices when they connect to the ISP's network.

## How ISP connect to internet
ISPs connect to the internet through one or more upstream providers or Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). An upstream provider is a larger ISP that provides connectivity to smaller ISPs or end-users, while an IXP is a physical location where multiple ISPs can exchange traffic with each other, allowing them to interconnect their networks and exchange data more efficiently.

To connect to the internet, an ISP typically needs to have its own network infrastructure, including routers, switches, and other networking equipment, as well as connections to one or more upstream providers or IXPs. These connections are typically made using high-speed data links, such as fiber optic cables or dedicated leased lines, which provide the necessary bandwidth to support large volumes of internet traffic.

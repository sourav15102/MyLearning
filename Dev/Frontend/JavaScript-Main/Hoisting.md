### Hoisting:
In JavaScript, the `let` keyword is used to declare block-scoped variables. Unlike `var` declarations, `let` declarations are not hoisted to the top of their scope.

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes before the code is executed. This means that `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, while their assignments remain in the same place. This allows you to use a variable before it is declared, but its value will be `undefined`.

However, `let` and `const` declarations are not hoisted in the same way that `var` declarations are. This means that if you try to use a `let` or `const` variable before it is declared, you will get a `ReferenceError`.

Here is an example:
```java
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
console.log(myLet); // Output: ReferenceError

var myVar = 'Hello';
let myLet = 'World';
```

In the above example, the `var` declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope, so `myVar` is declared and assigned `undefined` before it is used. However, the `let` declaration is not hoisted, so an error is thrown when we try to access `myLet` before it is declared.

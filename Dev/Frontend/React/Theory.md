### Theory:
- it helps create SPAs(Single Page Applications)
	- SPAs, or Single Page Applications, are web applications that load and render a single HTML page dynamically as the user interacts with the application. In a SPA, the server only sends the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and subsequent content is loaded via AJAX requests, without reloading the entire page. This allows for a more responsive and fluid user experience, as well as faster loading times and better performance.
- The flow of multipage applications:
	- When a user interacts with a multi-page application, the flow generally involves the following steps:
	
	1.  The user opens a page in their web browser by entering a URL or clicking a link. This triggers an HTTP request to the server hosting the application.
	2.  The server receives the request and processes it to determine which page the user is requesting. If the page requires dynamic content, the server may need to make requests to APIs or a database to retrieve the necessary data.
	3.  Once the server has all the necessary data, it generates an HTML document containing the page content and sends it back to the user's browser as an HTTP response.
	4.  The browser receives the response and renders the HTML to display the requested page to the user.
	5.  If the user interacts with the page, such as submitting a form or clicking a link to navigate to a different page, the browser sends another HTTP request to the server and the process repeats.

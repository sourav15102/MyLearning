#### HashSet
Certainly, let's go through the basic operations with their time complexities for a `HashSet` in Java:

1. **Create a HashSet:**
   ```java
   HashSet<Integer> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
   ```
   - **Time Complexity (TC):** O(1)
   - **Output:** Initializes an empty HashSet.

2. **Add Elements to the HashSet:**
   ```java
   hashSet.add(5);
   hashSet.add(10);
   hashSet.add(15);
   ```
   - **Time Complexity (TC):** O(1) average case, but O(n) in the worst case when dealing with collisions.
   - **Output:** No direct output; adds elements (5, 10, 15) to the HashSet.

3. **Check if an Element is Present:**
   ```java
   boolean containsElement = hashSet.contains(10);
   ```
   - **Time Complexity (TC):** O(1) on average.
   - **Output:** `containsElement` is true if 10 is present in the HashSet, false otherwise.

4. **Remove an Element from the HashSet:**
   ```java
   hashSet.remove(10);
   ```
   - **Time Complexity (TC):** O(1) average case, but O(n) in the worst case.
   - **Output:** No direct output; removes the element 10 from the HashSet.

5. **Iterate through the HashSet:**
   ```java
   for (Integer element : hashSet) {
       // Process each element
   }
   ```
   - **Time Complexity (TC):** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the HashSet.
   - **Output:** No direct output; iterates through each element in the HashSet.

6. **Check if the HashSet is Empty:**
   ```java
   if (hashSet.isEmpty()) {
       // HashSet is empty
   }
   ```
   - **Time Complexity (TC):** O(1)
   - **Output:** No direct output; checks if the HashSet is empty.

```java
// Using Iterator for HashSet
        Iterator<String> iterator = hashSet.iterator();

        // Iterating over elements
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            String element = iterator.next();
            System.out.println(element);
        }
```


These are general time complexities for the operations on a `HashSet` in Java. The actual performance may vary based on factors such as the hash function quality, load factor, and collisions. The worst-case time complexity for certain operations is influenced by potential collisions, which might result in linked list traversal in separate chaining hash table implementations.

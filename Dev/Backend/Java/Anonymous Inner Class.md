### Basics:
It is a way to create "one-time-use" class.
We can create anonymous inner class on top of any "class" or "interface".
For any class:
- when we create anonymous inner class on a class, we "kind of" create a subclass for that class and there we can override the methods.
For interface:
- when we create anonymous inner class on an interface, we "kind of" implement the interface, and there we can implement the methods.

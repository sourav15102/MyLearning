### Introduction
Microservices is an approach where an application is divided into smaller independent services, each with a specific task and communicating with each other through well-defined interfaces(lightweight message protocols). This architecture style allows for easy development, deployment, and scaling of individual services independently while improving fault tolerance and performance. However, it also introduces additional complexity that needs to be managed.

### When should one use this architecture
Sometimes an application can outgrow its monolithic architecture and become an obstacle to rapid, frequent and reliable software delivery. This typically happens when the application becomes large and complex and is developed by many teams. For example, its deployment pipeline become a bottleneck. When this occurs, you should consider migrating to microservices.

##### Run java without main
Yes, we can execute a java program without a main method **by using a static block**. Static block in Java is a group of statements that gets executed only once when the class is loaded into the memory by Java ClassLoader, It is also known as a static initialization block.

- `useState` allows functional components to have **state**, like `this.state` in class components.
- `useEffect` allows functional components to have **lifecycle methods** (such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount`) in one single API.

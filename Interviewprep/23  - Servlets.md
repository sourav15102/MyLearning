##### Servlet vs Servlet Containers:
- Servlets are a component of web development. They are basically Java programs that run inside the boundaries of a container. On the whole, **they are responsible for accepting a request, processing it, and sending a response back**.
- A servlet is a class that you will use to receive HTTP requests as methods and reply back with stuff (usually HTML).
- A servlet container is a server program which provides everything else; the opening of the socket, the transformation framework to turn HTTP into Java API calls, and a number of interfaces which allow you to plug in your servlet code.

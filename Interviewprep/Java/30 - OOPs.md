Programming paradigm revolved around objects.

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

Encapsulation can also be defined in two different ways:  
1) **Data hiding:** Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an object.  
2) **Data binding:** Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a class.

> Classes do not consume any memory. They are just a blueprint based on which objects are created. Now when objects are created, they actually initialize the class members and methods and therefore consume memory.


Declarative vs Imperative:
Declarative programming is a paradigm describing **WHAT** the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow.
Imperative programming is a paradigm describing **HOW** the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction
For example, SQL is a declarative language.

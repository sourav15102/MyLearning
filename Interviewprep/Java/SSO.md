> An authentication process: uses protocols like **SAML**, **OAuth 2.0**, or **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for the exchange of authentication data.


**Scenario**:
1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** allows a user to log in once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to re-enter credentials for each one.
2. An **Identity Provider (IdP)** handles the user's authentication and issues a token or assertion to the applications, enabling seamless access.

**Key Points**:
- **SSO** simplifies the user experience by reducing the need for multiple logins across different applications.
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: The central authority that authenticates the user and issues tokens or assertions.
- **Service Provider (SP)**: The applications that rely on the IdP to authenticate users and grant access.
- **Token/Assertion**: Used to prove the user's identity to different service providers. Common formats include **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) and **SAML** (Security Assertion Markup Language) assertions.

**Components of SSO**:
1. **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Authenticates the user and provides identity information to the service providers.
2. **Service Provider (SP)**: Relies on the IdP for user authentication.
3. **Authentication Token**: Issued by the IdP, containing information about the user's identity and permissions.
4. **Protocols**: SSO often uses protocols like **SAML**, **OAuth 2.0**, or **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for the exchange of authentication data.

**Flow**:
1. **User Authentication**: The user logs in to the IdP once.
2. **Token Issuance**: The IdP issues an authentication token or assertion.
3. **Access Multiple Services**: The user presents the token to various service providers, gaining access without re-entering credentials.
4. **Token Validation**: Each service provider validates the token with the IdP to ensure authenticity.

**Benefits**:
- **Improved User Experience**: Users log in once and access multiple services seamlessly.
- **Centralized Authentication**: Reduces the need for multiple credential management and enhances security.
- **Reduced Password Fatigue**: Minimizes the risk of password reuse across different applications.

**Conclusion**: SSO streamlines access to multiple applications by centralizing authentication through an **Identity Provider**, using tokens or assertions to verify user identity across services. This enhances both user convenience and security by reducing the need for repeated logins and password management.

### **SonarQube for Measuring Code Smells**

**Explanation**:
- SonarQube is a code quality tool that analyzes static code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
- It assigns a "Technical Debt Ratio" to measure the maintainability of code.
- The **30% reduction** was achieved by:
    - Fixing duplicate code, improper exception handling, and unused imports.
    - Refactoring functions with high cyclomatic complexity.

1. **What is OAuth, and how does it work for authorizing third-party applications to access user data?**  
    OAuth is an authorization framework that allows third-party apps to request limited access to a user's data without sharing passwords by using access tokens.
    
2. **How does OAuth 2.0 differ from OAuth 1.0?**  
    OAuth 2.0 replaced complex signature-based authentication with bearer tokens, introduced multiple grant types, and improved usability for mobile and web apps.
    
3. **What are the roles in OAuth, such as Authorization Server, Resource Server, Client, and Resource Owner?**
    
    - **Authorization Server:** Issues tokens after authenticating the user.
    - **Resource Server:** Hosts the protected resources and verifies access tokens.
    - **Client:** Requests access to the user’s data.
    - **Resource Owner:** The user who grants permission.
4. **Explain the Authorization Code Flow in OAuth. When should it be used?**  
    The Authorization Code Flow is a secure method where the client exchanges an authorization code for an access token; it's best for web and mobile apps needing long-term access.
    
5. **What is the difference between the Implicit Flow and Authorization Code Flow in OAuth?**  
    Implicit Flow directly returns the access token in the browser (now deprecated), while Authorization Code Flow securely exchanges an authorization code for an access token.
    
6. **Explain how the Client Credentials Flow works in OAuth 2.0 and when it is appropriate to use it.**  
    In Client Credentials Flow, the client (e.g., a backend service) authenticates with the authorization server using its client ID and secret to obtain an access token, ideal for machine-to-machine authentication.
    
7. **How does the Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow differ from the other OAuth flows?**  
    The Password Grant Flow requires users to enter their credentials directly into the client application, making it less secure and only suitable for trusted applications.
    
8. **What is the purpose of Scopes in OAuth, and how are they used in a real-world application?**  
    Scopes define the level of access a client can request, such as `read:user` for profile access or `write:post` for creating posts, ensuring least-privilege access.
    
9. **What are refresh tokens, and how do they contribute to OAuth security and usability?**  
    Refresh tokens allow clients to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication, improving usability while keeping access tokens short-lived for security.
    
10. **How does OAuth 2.0 handle token expiration and token revocation?**  
    Access tokens expire after a set time, requiring refresh tokens for renewal, and can be revoked via a token revocation endpoint if compromised.
    
11. **How would you handle token theft in an OAuth system?**  
    Implement short-lived access tokens, detect anomalies using IP/device fingerprinting, and allow users to revoke tokens if theft is suspected.
    
12. **Explain the concept of OAuth tokens (access token, refresh token) and their lifecycle.**
    
    - **Access token:** Short-lived, used to access resources.
    - **Refresh token:** Long-lived, used to get new access tokens when they expire.
13. **How can you secure communication between OAuth clients and authorization servers?**  
    Use HTTPS for all requests, validate redirect URIs, store secrets securely, and use PKCE for public clients.
    
14. **What is PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), and how does it enhance security in OAuth 2.0?**  
    PKCE protects against authorization code interception by requiring a client-generated proof when exchanging the authorization code for an access token.
    
15. **What are OAuth Scopes, and how do they limit the permissions granted to third-party applications?**  
    Scopes define which resources or actions the client can access, preventing over-permissioned applications from accessing more data than necessary.
    
16. **How do you implement OAuth2 with PKCE in mobile and web applications for improved security?**  
    Generate a `code_verifier`, send its hashed form (`code_challenge`) in the authorization request, then validate it during the token exchange.
    
17. **What are the main vulnerabilities in OAuth 2.0, and how can you mitigate them?**
    
    - **Access token leakage** → Use HTTPS and store tokens securely.
    - **Open redirect attacks** → Validate redirect URIs.
    - **Authorization code interception** → Use PKCE.
18. **What are the best practices for implementing OAuth 2.0 in a distributed system?**  
    Use JWTs for scalable authentication, enforce scope-based access, implement centralized token revocation, and use API gateways for security.
    
19. **Can OAuth be used for single sign-on? If so, explain how.**  
    Yes, OAuth with OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows users to log in once and access multiple apps using ID tokens for authentication.
    
20. **How do you implement OAuth2.0 with API Gateway and manage access control?**  
    API Gateway validates OAuth tokens before forwarding requests, enforces scopes for API access, and integrates with an identity provider for authentication.

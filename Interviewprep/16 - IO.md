- The stream is a sequence of data that flows from source to destination.

Three default streams in java: They all belong to ``java.lang`` package which is loaded by default.
1. System.out
```java
`System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // Prints "Hello, World!" with a new line`
`System.out.print("Hello, "); // Prints "Hello, " without a new line.
`double price = 19.99; 
System.out.printf("The price is: $%20.2f%n", price); // Formats and prints the price with a width of 20 characters, including 2 decimal places // Output: "The price is: $               19.99"`

Explanation: `%20.2f` specifies a floating-point number (`f`) with a minimum width of 20 characters, including 2 decimal places. The width includes both the digits and any padding spaces needed to meet the width.
```
2. System.in
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class InputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = reader.readLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}
// Outputs:
// Enter your name: John
// Hello, John
```
3. System.err
```java
System.err.println("This is an error message!"); // Prints an error message to the error stream
```


**Q: Hierarchy of Streams**
A:
All the stream classes can be divided into two types of classes that are ByteStream classes and CharacterStream Classes. The ByteStream classes are further divided into InputStream classes and OutputStream classes. CharacterStream classes are also divided into Reader classes and Writer classes. The SuperMost classes for all the InputStream classes is java.io.InputStream and for all the output stream classes is java.io.OutPutStream. Similarly, for all the reader classes, the super-most class is java.io.Reader, and for all the writer classes, it is java.io.Writer.

Types of stream:
1. Input Stream: These streams are used to read data that must be taken as an input from a source array or file or any peripheral device
![[Java-Input-Stream.png]]
3.Output Stream: These streams are used to write data as outputs into an array or file or any output peripheral device
![[Java-Output-Stream.png]]

Both input and output streams can be of kind: 
1. Character Stream
2. ByteStream

Lets discuss both of these first.
1. **ByteStream:** This is used to process data byte by byte (8 bits).
	1. Examples:
		1. FileInputStream is used to read from the source
		2. FileOutputStream is used to write to the destination
2. Character stream: Automatically allows us to read/write data character by character. 
	1. Example:
		1. FileReader: character streams used to read from the source
		2. FileWriter: character streams used to write to the destination


**Q: What is the difference between the Reader/Writer class hierarchy and the InputStream/OutputStream class hierarchy?**
A:
- The Reader/Writer class hierarchy is character-oriented, and the InputStream/OutputStream class hierarchy is byte-oriented. 
- The ByteStream classes are used to perform input-output of 8-bit bytes 
- CharacterStream classes are used to perform the input/output for the 16-bit Unicode system.
- ByteStream: FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
- CharacterStream: FileReader and FileWriter.

**Q: Diff between buffered(BOS) and file output(FOS) stream**
A:
```
Input and output operations typically involve relatively expensive operations like disk access, network activity, etc. Performing this often can make a program less efficient.
We have “buffered streams” of data in Java to handle these scenarios. _BufferedOutputStream_ **writes data to a buffer instead which is flushed to the destination less often**, when the buffer gets full, or the method _flush()_ is called.
```

First of all, BOS wraps another output stream - every byte you write to the BOS will eventually be written to the underlying output stream, which could be a FileOutputStream, a ByteArrayOutputStream, or others.

Meanwhile, FOS is "standalone" - it writes directly to a file. It doesn't have an underlying output stream.

BOS stores the written bytes in a temporary buffer and flushes it when it is filled up, or when you call the flush method. Flushing simply writes the contents of the buffer to the underlying stream. This makes it more efficient, instead if writing each byte you only write once you've accumulated enough of them.

FOS on the other hand might have an internal buffering mechanism, but you have no control over it other than the flush method.


**Q: What are the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream?**
A:
Java FileOutputStream
- You can write byte-oriented as well as character-oriented data through the FileOutputStream class.
- However, for character-oriented data, it is preferred to use FileWriter than FileOutputStream.

```java
1. import java.io.FileOutputStream;    
2. public class FileOutputStreamExample {    
3.     public static void main(String args[]){      
4.            try{      
5.              FileOutputStream fout=new FileOutputStream("D:\\testout.txt");      
6.              fout.write(65);      
7.              fout.close();      
8.              System.out.println("success...");      
9.             }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}      
10.       }      
11. }   
```

Java FileInputStream class:
- It is used for reading byte-oriented data (streams of raw bytes) such as image data, audio, video, etc.
- You can also read character-stream data. However, for reading streams of characters, it is recommended to use FileReader class.

```java
1. import java.io.FileInputStream;    
2. public class DataStreamExample {    
3.      public static void main(String args[]){      
4.           try{      
5.             FileInputStream fin=new FileInputStream("D:\\testout.txt");      
6.             int i=fin.read();    
7.             System.out.print((char)i);      

9.             fin.close();      
10.           }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}      
11.          }      
12.         }    
```

**Q: What is the purpose of using BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream classes?**
A:
Java BufferedOutputStream class is used for buffering an output stream. It internally uses a buffer to store data. It adds more efficiency than to write data directly into a stream. So, it makes the performance fast. Whereas, Java BufferedInputStream class is used to read information from the stream. It internally uses the buffer mechanism to make the performance fast.

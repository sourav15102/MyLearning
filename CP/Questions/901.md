### Trick:
- usually we would pop out the top element if `st.peek() <= price`, but in this case if we pop that out, we would loose the `span` it had.
- To keep track of span of those elements we need second stack.
- span for each element in second stack is accumulation of elements lower or = to it in history.
- by transitive property, if {x,y,z} <= p and if p <=z then {x,y,z} <= z as well.
 
### Code:
```java
class StockSpanner {
    private Stack<Integer> pr;
    private Stack<Integer> sp;
    public StockSpanner() {
        pr = new Stack<>();
        sp = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        if(pr.isEmpty()){
            pr.push(price);
            sp.push(1);
            return sp.peek();
        }
        int sm=0;

        while(!pr.isEmpty() && pr.peek()<=price){
            pr.pop();
            sm = sm + sp.pop();
        }
        pr.push(price);
        sp.push(sm+1);

        return sp.peek();
    }
}
```

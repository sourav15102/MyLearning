### Idea:
1. lets take an example: 2 2 2 3 4 7 8 9, so we have 5,6 places empty: extra 2's to can go to 5th and 6th placeswhcih will take 7 moves.
	1. also, we can move extra 2s to 3rd and 4th places and 3 and 4 can move to 5th and 6th places, answer will be same as 7.
2. Following second approach has simple implementation and we dont need to deal with large increments (leading to overflow in 1st implementation) 

```java
class Solution {
    public int minIncrementForUnique(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]<=nums[i-1]){
                ans += nums[i-1]+1 - nums[i];
                nums[i] = nums[i-1]+1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

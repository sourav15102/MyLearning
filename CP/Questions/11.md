### Trick:
- For each element going from left to right and right to left, if we can figure out the farthest element bigger or equal, then for that element's full capacity we have maximized its width, and so with that element in its full capacity, we have maximized the volume.
- If we do that for each element, we can figure out the answer.
- [[Farthest smaller to right - BS]]
- However, this method takes nlogn.by most recent bigger.
- NOTE: fathest smaller cant be found 
Another approach
- lets try by brute force first, we can try every combination of two poles and then calc volume.
- lets start from 0th and n-1th, if n-1th is smaller, it means since we have the maximum width right now, this is max vol n-1th can have. we can move it to 0th -- n-2th now, now we will keep doing till we find jth(right one) that is bigger than 0th, so now 0th has found its max vol, there is no point in decreasing j now for 0th.
- now move to next pointer, 1st, there is point of starting 1st from the very end i.e. n-1th, cos, those have already found best combo and max vol.
- so, now if we track our move(where we have just optimized brute force) it like we move smaller pointer every time.

### Code
```js
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = height.length-1;

        int ans = 0;

        while(i<j){
            int xx = (j-i)*Math.min(height[i], height[j]);
            ans = Math.max(ans, xx);

            if(height[i]<height[j]){
                i++;
            }else{
                j--;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

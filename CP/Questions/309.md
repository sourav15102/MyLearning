### Idea:
- this can be done with 1d DP.
- lets say for arr starting at 0th index, we can starting finding out the max stock price, lets say the right index is j, then bought at i, and sold at j, then start recursion at j+2.
- now the catch is, that lets ay we found max from i --> X, but now moving right from X,  i--> is smaller than i-->X, so there is no point in calculating recursion(j+2), cos it is going to be lesser than i-->X anyways.

### Code:
```java
class Solution {
    private int sol(int[] prices, int[] dp, int ind){
        if(ind>=prices.length){
            return 0;
        }

        if(dp[ind]!=-1){
            return dp[ind];
        }

        int i = ind;
        int j = ind;
        int mx = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for(;j<prices.length;j++){
            if(prices[j]<prices[i]){
                i = j;
            }
            int tmp = prices[j]-prices[i];
            if(tmp>mx){
                mx = tmp;
                ans = Math.max(ans, mx + sol(prices, dp, j+2));
            }
        }
        dp[ind] = ans;
        return dp[ind];
    }
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int l = prices.length;
        if(l==0 || l==1){
            return 0;
        }

        int[] dp = new int[l];
        Arrays.fill(dp,-1);

        return sol(prices, dp, 0);
    }
}
```

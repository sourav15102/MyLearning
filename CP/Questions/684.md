### Idea 1:
- We can `union find (with rank)` to find cycle in undirected graph.
- if we are connecting two nodes which have same parent (already are part of tree), then we are basically making a cycle.
### Code 1:
```java
class Solution {
    private int find(int x, int[] p){
        if(x==p[x]){
            return x;
        }
        return find(p[x],p);
    }
    private void union(int x, int y, int[] p, int[] r){
        if(r[x]<r[y]){
            p[x] = y;
            r[y] += r[x];
        }else{
            p[y] = x;
            r[x] += r[y];
        }
    }
    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        int n = edges.length;
        int[] parent = new int[n+1];
        int[] rank = new int[n+1];
        Arrays.fill(rank,1);

        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }

        int[] ans = new int[2];
        int a,b;

        for(int[] e: edges){
            a = find(e[0],parent);
            b = find(e[1],parent);
            if(a==b){
                ans = e;
                break;
            }
            union(a,b,parent,rank);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Idea 2:
- So  basically, we can add edges to graph one by one and see if there is a cycle, and return the edge where we found cycle.
- we need to empty vis boolean array everytime why?
	- idea for vis array was that if we have visited a branch already, there is no need to go down that lane again, cos if there was a cycle there the current node would have been a part of it and we would have found it already, now lets say after adding 2nd edge(no cycle yet) we dont empty the vis, and while adding 3rd edge if we encounter the previously visited nodes the algo would assume that there is no cycle there!!, a wrong assumption cos now with new edge present there very well could be a cycle present there, which previously wasn't there.
	- see `//HERE` in code.
### Code 2:
```java
class Solution {
    private int[] ans;
    private boolean cycle(List<Integer>[] graph, int ind, boolean[] vis, boolean[] anc, int parent){
        vis[ind] = true;
        anc[ind] = true;

        for(int ch: graph[ind]){
            if(ch!=parent && anc[ch]){
                return true;
            }
            if(!vis[ch]){
                if(cycle(graph, ch, vis, anc, ind)){
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        anc[ind] = false;
        return false;
    }
    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        int l = edges.length;
        int m = edges[0].length;

        List<Integer>[] graph = new List[l+1];
        for(int i=0;i<=l;i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        boolean[] vis = new boolean[l+1];
        Arrays.fill(vis, false);
        boolean[] anc = new boolean[l+1];
        Arrays.fill(anc, false);

        for(int[] e: edges){
            graph[e[0]].add(e[1]);
            graph[e[1]].add(e[0]);
            if(cycle(graph,e[0],vis,anc,-1)){
                return e;
            }
            Arrays.fill(vis, false); //HERE
        }
        ans = new int[2];
        return ans;
    }
}
```

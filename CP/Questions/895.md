### Trick: 
- keeping track of maximum frequency is straight forward(MAIN MAP).
- After that there are basically two issues:
	- at any point for max frequency we need to maintain that which number was pushed latest.
	- and after popping out the max frequency, we need to calculate the next max frequency is and which value its corresponds to.
- For the first one, aside from frequency map which we have maintained for each number, we can maintain another map for each frequency, where the value will contain a stack maintaining the order in which the numbers corresponding to this frequency were entered.
> hint for the above is that since we need to maintain the order in which they were entered in case there frequencies clash.
- For second one, when we pop out the number at the top of the stack for max frequency(also update the frequency in the MAIN MAP), we can immediately know that what was the next number for the max frequency is and incase the stack is now empty, we know that the next max frequency is one less than the previous one(max--).

> The concept of min stack wont work here, cos the basic idea behind it is that lets say we have `[a,b` in stack and if `a<b` then we know that as long as `a` exists `b` can never be smallest, and there wont be a case where `b` exists and `a` doesn't, that is cos of the nature of the stack, which will always remove b first, and since:
> for this questions we are removing elements even from between the stack same principle cannot be applied here.

### Code:
```java
class FreqStack {
    Map<Integer,Integer> freq;
    Map<Integer,Stack<Integer>> mp;
    int maxf;

    public FreqStack() {
        mp = new HashMap<>();
        freq = new HashMap<>();
        maxf = 0;
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        int ff = freq.getOrDefault(val,0)+1;
        freq.put(val, ff);
        if(ff>maxf){
            maxf = ff;
        }

        Stack<Integer> st = mp.getOrDefault(ff, new Stack<>());
        st.push(val);
        mp.put(ff,st);
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        Stack<Integer> st = mp.get(maxf);
        int ans = st.pop();
        mp.put(maxf,st);
        freq.put(ans, freq.get(ans)-1);
        if(st.isEmpty()){
            maxf--;
        }
        return ans;
    }

}

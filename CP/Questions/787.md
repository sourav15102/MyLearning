### Idea:
- Why [[Dijkstra]] wouldn't work here?
	- It doesn't traditionally keep track of `hops`, because we are choosing the node with minimum total distance from source.
	- It would be tough to modify it for this problem.
- Why [[Bellman Ford]] wouldn't work here?
	- It works under theorem that if in worst case the shortest path between a->b has n `hops`, then it would be resolved in at max n-1 iterations, but it could get resolved before n-1 iterations (meaning it could cover the seemingly shortest distance containing n `hops`, before n-1 iterations.
	- Using this traditionally we cannot restrict it to `k` hops, cos running k or k-1 iterations could cover more hops.
- Why `BFS` would work here?
	- BFS already keeps track of `hops`, just here in the queue, we need to maintain different version with different distances, cos, each version represent a diff hop, and we dont know which version might satisfy the condition of at most `k hops`.

### Idea:
- Basically the idea is that among the bunch of `n` colliding intervals, we can keep only one.
- So, which `n-1` we need to remove?
- We will keep the one which has least chances of colliding with future intervals, and discard the rest.
- and that one will be with the leftest ending point.
### Code:
```java
class Solution {
    private boolean overlap(int[] x, int[] y){
        return (x[0]<y[1] && y[0]<x[1]);
    }
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, new Comparator<int[]>(){
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b){
                if(a[1]!=b[1]){
                    return a[1]-b[1];
                }else{
                    return a[0]-b[0];
                }
            }
        });

        int ans = 0;
        int i=0,j;
        int[] tmp;
        while(i<intervals.length){
            tmp = intervals[i];
            j = i+1;
            while(j<intervals.length && overlap(tmp, intervals[j])){
                ans++;
                j++;
            }
            i = j;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

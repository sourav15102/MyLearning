### Trick:
- thing to focus on is that in 132 at (i<j<k) pattern.
- consider each element as potential "3".
- going left to right, for each "3", keep track of minimum element.
- cos "1" has to be minimum anyways.
- so, till now we have got "1" for each "3".
- not instead of searching "2" for each "3", we will search "3" for each "2".
- Now, the idea is that we will find most recent potential "3" for each "2" towards its left.
- Why there is no need to consider every "3" towards left of "2"?
	- because our goal is to keep our number("2") between the range of potential "3" and minimum number till that "3".
	- now when we calculate minimum from left to right, the nature is that the minimum number till ith index will be decreasing or in worst case remaining same.
	- so, "2" is anyway going to be less than every "3" left of it.
	- so the best chance for each "2" to be in the range of "3" and "1", is the recent "3" towards the left.
### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean find132pattern(int[] nums) {
        int l = nums.length;
        int[] mn = new int[l];
        mn[0] = nums[0];

        for(int i=1;i<l;i++){
            mn[i] = Math.min(mn[i-1],nums[i]);
        }

        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
        int[] left = new int[l];
        Arrays.fill(left,-1);

        for(int i=l-1;i>=0;i--){
            while(!st.isEmpty() && nums[st.peek()]<nums[i]){
                left[st.peek()] = i;
                st.pop();
            }
            st.push(i);
        }

        int pt;
        boolean ans = false;
        for(int i=1;i<l;i++){
            pt = left[i];
            if(pt>0){
                if(mn[pt-1]<nums[i]){
                    ans = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}

### Idea
- If we choose 0th, then the length of array becomes l-1, as we cant choose last element now.
- if we dont choose 0th, then length is l, as we can choose last element now.
- HOWEVER, DP array of both of these calls CAN'T be same, as they are completely two diff states now. (CAN be done by 2d dp also).
- so, refresh your dp before making calls.

### Code:
```java
class Solution {

    private int sol(int[] nums, int[] dp, int ind, int mx){
        if(ind>mx){
            return 0;
        }

        if(dp[ind]!=-1){
            return dp[ind];
        }

        int a = nums[ind] + sol(nums, dp, ind+2, mx);
        int b = sol(nums, dp, ind+1, mx);
        dp[ind] = Math.max(a,b);

        return dp[ind];

    }

    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int l = nums.length;
        if(l==0){
            return 0;
        }
        int[] dp = new int[l];
        Arrays.fill(dp,-1);
        int a = nums[0]+sol(nums, dp, 2, l-2);
        Arrays.fill(dp,-1);
        int b =  sol(nums, dp, 1, l-1);

        return Math.max(a,b);
    }
}
```

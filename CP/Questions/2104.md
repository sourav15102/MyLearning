Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-ranges/solutions/1626628/o-n-solution-with-monotonous-stack-full-explaination

Idea:
- for each subarray we need to sum (max1 - min1) + (max2 - min2) + (max3 - min3) = (max1+2+3) - (min1-2-3).
- so basically we can find the range within which a number is minimum, add its contribution to the sum, do it for every number, mark it as MIN.
- Do same for maximum number and mark it as MAX
- MAX - MIN would be the answer.

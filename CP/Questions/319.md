### Idea:
- The idea is revolving around number of times a bulb would be hit.
- The `hit` a number would take is equal to the number of divisors, bulbs are initially off, (1 switch them all on)
- Talking about the divisors, lets say 8 would have even number of divisors, (1,8) (2,4) always in pairs and even.
- However, if number is a perfect square, then they would have odd number of divisors, lets say 16: (1,16), (2,8), (4,4)
- CAUTION: `md*md` can cross int bounds 
### Code:
```java
class Solution {
    private int sol(int x, int y, int n){
        if(x>y){
            return y;
        }
		// md
        int md = x+(y-x)/2;
        if((n/md) < md){
            return sol(x,md-1,n);
        }else{
            return sol(md+1,y,n);
        }
    }
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        if(n==1 || n==0){
            return n;
        }
        int a = 1;
        int b = n;

        return sol(a,b,n);
    }
}
```

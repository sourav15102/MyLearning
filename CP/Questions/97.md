### Idea:
- state? initially state might look like: ath ind, bth in, cth ind and whose turn is it a or b to be compared (cos we need a and b to be alternatively intertwined).
- but if we look closely, state is something that  (out of all possible brute force combinations) can identify the position of "run" uniquely.
- So, it identify it uniquely, we actually dont need cth index. Why? cos since c has to be made completely from a and b, wherever we are in a and b we can identify where we are in c. (no. of chars spent in a + b = c).
- Also, we dont need to keep track of which string to compare alternatively, cos, we can choose ind and ind-1 index from a one after the another, we can totally do that as in that case we would make ind+ind-1 as a single "chunk". Chunks can be of any size.
### Code:
```java
class Solution {
    private int getind(char[] a, int x, char[] b, int y, char[] c){
       int spent =  a.length - x - 1 + b.length - y -1; 
       return c.length - spent - 1;
    }
    private boolean sol(char[] a, int x, char[] b, int y, char[] c, int[][] dp){
        if(x<0 && y<0){
            return true;
        }

        if(dp[x+1][y+1]!=-1){
            return (dp[x+1][y+1]==1);
        }

        int ind = getind(a,x,b,y,c);
        boolean m;
        m = false;
        if(x>=0 && c[ind]==a[x]){
            m = sol(a,x-1, b,y, c,dp);
        }
        if(!m && y>=0 && c[ind]==b[y]){
            m = sol(a,x,b,y-1,c,dp);
        }
        dp[x+1][y+1] = (m==true)?1:0;
        return m;

    }
    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        char[] a = s1.toCharArray();
        char[] b = s2.toCharArray();
        char[] c = s3.toCharArray();
        int p = a.length;
        int q = b.length;
        int r = c.length;

        if((p+q)!=r){
            return false;
        }

        int[][] dp = new int[p+1][q+1];
        for(int i=0;i<=p;i++){
            Arrays.fill(dp[i],-1);
        }

        return sol(a,p-1, b, q-1,c, dp);
    
    }
}

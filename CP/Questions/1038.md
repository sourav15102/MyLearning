### Idea:
- whatever we have as offset (we are getting from above), we will keep passing it to the right, when hit null just pass it.
- always return the value of left node to the parent, cos left will contain the sum of the entire tree, sand root wants sum of entire right tree to be added in it.
- after getting sum of entire right tree, dont add offset again as we already added it once while hitting null.
### Code:
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private int sol(TreeNode root, int off){
        if(root==null){
            return off;
        }

        int right = sol(root.right, off);
        root.val += right;
        int left = sol(root.left, root.val);

        return left;
    } 
    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        int offset = 0;
        sol(root, offset);
        return root;
    }
}
```

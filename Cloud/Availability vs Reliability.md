Availability refers to the ability of a cloud service to be accessible and operational for users whenever they need it. It measures the percentage of time that a service is up and running without any disruptions or outages. Higher availability means that the service is consistently accessible and minimizes downtime. Cloud service providers often strive for high availability by implementing redundant systems, failover mechanisms, and robust infrastructure to ensure continuous service even in the event of hardware failures or network issues.

Reliability, on the other hand, focuses on the consistency and dependability of a cloud service to perform its intended functions accurately and predictably. It relates to the overall stability and trustworthiness of the service in delivering the expected results. Reliable cloud services should consistently provide the desired level of performance, data integrity, and functionality without unexpected errors or failures. Reliability is often achieved through rigorous testing, quality assurance processes, and fault-tolerant design principles.

While availability emphasizes uninterrupted access, reliability emphasizes consistent performance.

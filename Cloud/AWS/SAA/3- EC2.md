Security groups:
- reference ip addresses and other security groups.
- only have "allow"
- can be attached to multiple instances.
- multuple security groups can be attached to one instance.
- locked to region/vpc combination.
- Control both inbound and outbound rules.
	- control both IPv4/v6 ranges and ports for both.
> generally have diff security group rules for inbound(blocked: default) and outbound traffic(authorized: default).
> also separate one for SSH access

how to connect to instance:
- ssh: all by windows(>=10)
- putty: all windows
- ec2 instance connect: all, on browser, amazon linux 2

Purchasing options:
1. On demand
	1. Highest cost, no upfront, no long term commitment
	2. For Short term and uninterrupted workload.
	3. Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
	4. All other operating systems - billing per hour
2. Reserved instances
	1. Standard:
		1. We reserve: 
			1. Instance Type
			2. Region
			3. Tenancy
			4. OS 
			5. scope (regional or zonal).
		2. Can Modify:
			1. AZ
			2. Scope
			3. Instance size with same type
		3. Reserved instance marketplace: buy/sell
	2. Convertible:
		1. Can change: Instance type, family, OS, scope and tenancy.
		2. Cannot be soled on Reserved instance marketplace.
	 - period: 1 or 3 yrs
	 - no, partial and all upfront.
	 - for steady stage usage
3. Savings plan:
	1. Commit to certain type of usage: 10/hr for 1 or 3 year
	2. Locked to region and instance family.
	3. Flexible across:
		1. Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
		2. OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
		3. Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)
	4.  billed at the On-Demand price
4. Spot instances:
	1. most cost efficient.
	2. Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
			• Batch jobs
			• Data analysis
			• Image processing
			• Any distributed workloads
			• Workloads with a flexible start and end time
		• Not suitable for critical jobs or databases
1. Dedicated Host:
	1. instance placement
	2. most expensive
	3. for license and company regulatory needs.
2. Dedicated instance
	1. no control over instance placement.
	2. instances run on hardware dedicated to us, it may share it with other instances in same account.
3. Capacity reservation:
	1. reserve capacity in an AZ
	2. can cancel at any time.
	3. no time commitment
	4. but no discounts as well.

How Spot request works:
- We have it as long as the `max spot price we are willing to pay` > current price.
		- if not, we get 2 mins grace period, where we can choose to stop(maintains state) or terminate the instance.
		- we have hourly spot price that varies.

Spot request:

One-time:
- spot request is processed
- we get instances
- request go away.
Persistent:
- in case the instances are stopped or interrupted, request will be processed again and we will get instances again.
- it will be maintained from 'valid from to valid until'

How to terminate spot instances in persistent request type:
1. first we cancel the request
2. then terminate the associated instances

Spot fleet:
- set spot instances + on demand instances(optional)
- we define multiple launch pools:  instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone
- fleet will choose best pool for you.
- when fleet reaches budget or capacity, it stops
Strategy to allocate instances in fleet:
1. Lowest price: from lowest price pool --> cost optimization
2. diversified: distributed across all pools --> availability
3. capacityOptimized: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
4. priceCapacityOptimized (recommended): pools with highest capacity available, then select
the pool with the lowest price (best choice for most workloads)

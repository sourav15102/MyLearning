### S3
> infinite scaling

- store object(files) in buckets(dir)
- buckets have globally unique name, all region, all account
- NOT gloabal, buckets are defined for region.
Bucket naming convention:
Naming convention
• No uppercase, No underscore
• 3-63 characters long
• Not an IP
• Must start with lowercase letter or number
• Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
• Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias

objects:
- object have a key, values, metadata, tags, version id(if enabled).
- ![[Pasted image 20230506192054.png]]
- no dirs inside bucket
- just long nameed keys
- objct 

content of object:
1. key
2. value: content, 5TB, >5GB multi part upload (recommended when size>100mb)
3. metadata: key/value pairs
4. tags: key/value pairs, for security
5. version id

who can access S3:
- user based: IAM policy
- resource-based: Bucket policy, Obj ACL, bucket ACL, (Access control list)

> even if we have public access on bucket policy, public access is blocked on account level

Replication: Must enable versioning
since it is regional, we need replication:
CRR: lower latency
SRR: test/prod 

Classes:
Durability: 11 9s, 10mil -10thous.
1. general purpose: 99.99% availability
	1. low latency - high throughput, 
	2. big data analytics, mobile/pc gaming
2. IA:
	1. standard: 99.9%
		1. disaster recovery,backups
	2. one zone: 99.5%
		1. scondary backup on prem
3. Glacier: for archive backup
	1. instant: minisec
	2. flexible: 1-5min, 3-5hrs, 5-12hrs
	3. deep archive: for long term: 12 standard,24hrs bulk
4. Intelligent tering:
	1. automatic tiering b/w classes: only standard and standard IA
	2. no retrieval cost
	3. monitoring+auto tiering cost

Encryption:
- server side: default
- client side

>SRP: `[154]`

For edge location: if it takes >1 week to transfer data, use snow family.
- data migration:
	- snowcone
	- snowball edge
	- snowmobile
- edge computing:
	-  snowcone
	- snowball edge
Snowball:
- storage optimized
- compute optimized

Snowcone:
- lighter than snowball.
- can be sent back or DataSync

>if using more than 10pb than switch from ball to mobile.

> Types of Storage Gateway:
• File Gateway
• Volume Gateway
• Tape Gateway

Security:
two types of policies:
1. Identity based policy: customer, aws managed, inline
2. resource based policy: always inline.(embede din user, grp, role)

How to do security:
• User-Based:
  - IAM Policies: Determine allowed API calls for specific IAM users.
• Resource-Based:
  - Bucket Policies: Enforce rules at the bucket level, even across accounts.
• Access Control Lists (ACLs):
  - Object ACL: Fine-grained control, can be disabled.
  - Bucket ACL: Less common, can be disabled.
• Note: An IAM user can access S3 objects if:
  - User's IAM permissions ALLOW it, OR resource policy ALLOWS it.
  - No explicit DENY present.
• Encryption: Secure S3 objects with encryption keys.

Block public access;
- on by default.
- can be set at account level.

Amazon S3 – Replication Methods
• Enable Versioning in both source and destination buckets.
• Cross-Region Replication (CRR):
  - Replicate across AWS regions.
• Same-Region Replication (SRR):
  - Replicate within the same region.
• Replication works between buckets in different accounts.
• Asynchronous copying process.
• Grant appropriate IAM permissions to S3.
• Use cases:
  - CRR: Compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts.
  - SRR: Log aggregation, live replication between production and test.

Amazon S3 – Replication (Additional Information)
• Enabling replication only affects new objects, not existing ones.
• Use S3 Batch Replication to replicate existing and failed objects.
• Replication covers DELETE operations:
  - Delete markers can be replicated (optional).
  - Deletions with version IDs aren't replicated to prevent malicious actions.
• Replication doesn't chain across buckets:
  - If Bucket 1 replicates to Bucket 2, and Bucket 2 to Bucket 3,
  - Objects in Bucket 1 won't replicate to Bucket 3 directly.
- There is no “chaining” of replication

Extra:
The difference between "deletions with a specific version ID" and "deletion markers" lies in how they handle object deletions in Amazon S3 with versioning enabled.

1. **Deletions with a Specific Version ID:** When you delete an object with a specific version ID, you are targeting the deletion of a particular version of an object. This means that you are explicitly specifying the version you want to delete, and only that version will be removed. The rest of the versions of that object, if any, remain unaffected. This is a precise and targeted deletion.
    
2. **Deletion Markers:** In Amazon S3, when you delete an object (without specifying a version ID), a "deletion marker" is created. A deletion marker is a non-existent object that acts as a placeholder to indicate that a particular version of an object has been deleted. It allows S3 to maintain a record of the deletion while still retaining other versions of the object. The deletion marker is used to track that a particular version is logically deleted, but the actual data is retained for other versions.

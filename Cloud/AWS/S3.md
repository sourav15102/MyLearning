fIA

- Bucket is regional vs
- s3 is global

### Access to S3 bucket and objects:
- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/iam-policies-and-bucket-policies-and-acls-oh-my-controlling-access-to-s3-resources/
- Buckets and Objects are private and protected by default.

### Encryption

- by default versioning is not enabled
- S3 Object Versioning is not enabled by default and has to be explicitly enabled for each bucket and applied to all objects within the bucket. **Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled and can only be suspended**
- Difference between disabling and suspening? 
- Amazon S3 is **strongly consistent** for all new and existing objects in all Regions.


### Classes:
- Standard: highhest availability
	- frequent, low latency, high throuhput
	- for data lakes, cloud-native apps, wesbite, content distribution
- Intelligent-Tiering
	- automatically move between access tiers
	- for apps that have chanign access patterns
- Standard-IA
	- for accessed monthly - milisecond retrieval
	- backup, disaster recovery.
- Glacier instant retrieval: 
	- for once per quarter accessed - milisecond retreival
	- long term archive - immediate retreival
- Glacier flexible retreival: highhest availability
	- archive - backup - slow retrieval
	- speeds
		- expedited 1-5 mins
		- standard 3-5 hrs
		- bulk - 12 hours
- Glacier deep archive: highhest availability
	- for once/year - 12 -48 hours
	- eliminate on-prem tape lib
	- speeds:
		- standard - 12hrs
		- bulk - 48 hrs
- one zone IA: lowest availability
	- for easily recretible data
- S3 on outposts
	- object storage on-prem aws outposts

Lifecycle vs Intelligent tiering:
The Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class automatically stores objects in three access tiers. One tier is optimized for frequent access, one lower-cost tier is optimized for infrequent access, and another very low-cost tier is optimized for rarely accessed data
The life cycle management supports all the S3 Storage classes**

Multipart:
- only use for files > 100MB and in situations where network connectivity might be inconsistent
- Quick recovery from network issues: If transmission of any part fails, only need to retransmit that part  
- Ability to pause and resume object uploads  
- Improved throughput: Upload parts in parallel to improve throughput

S3 Transfer Acceleration:
- isntead of using internet to upload bobjects to bucket, we use cloudfront instead which uses optimized network protocols.

### Use Cases:
- Athena and quicksight can be used for analysis.
- Store and distribute web content and media  
- Host static websites  
- Data store for computation and analytics  
- Back up and archive critical data

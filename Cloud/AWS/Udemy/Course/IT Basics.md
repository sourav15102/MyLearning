HUB:
- when certain signal comes to a certain port it broadcast to all other ports.
- When A sends frames to C, it broadcasts, but only C will accept as it is set as dest, and all others will reject.

SWITCH:
- unlike hub, switch will look at the content, it will look at the destination and will only send to the dest.
- it keeps table to remeber which system is connected to which port.

BRIDGE
- connects two networks.
- see link for more.

ROUTER:
- takes packets from internal private network, lets say switch and push it to internet.
- it has private ip address(gateway for the systems in subnet) and public ip address.
- look link for complete process.

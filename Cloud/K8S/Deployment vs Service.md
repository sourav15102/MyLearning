**Deployment**: A Deployment in Kubernetes is responsible for managing and maintaining a set of identical Pods. It ensures that the desired number of Pods are running and provides features for scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks. A Deployment defines the desired state of the application and takes care of creating and managing the necessary Pods to match that state. It is primarily focused on managing the lifecycle of Pods and ensuring the application is running as expected.

**Service**: A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy for accessing them. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name to represent a set of Pods, allowing other components within the cluster to access the Pods without needing to know their specific IP addresses. Services act as an internal load balancer, distributing incoming traffic to the Pods based on a defined set of rules. Services are decoupled from the underlying Pod instances, allowing Pods to be added, removed, or replaced without affecting the overall availability of the Service.

**Difference**: The main difference between a Deployment and a Service is their focus and purpose. A Deployment is responsible for managing and maintaining the lifecycle of Pods, ensuring the desired number of Pods are running and handling updates. It is primarily concerned with the application's deployment and scaling aspects. On the other hand, a Service is responsible for providing a stable network endpoint for accessing a set of Pods. It acts as a load balancer and handles the routing of incoming traffic to the Pods behind it.
